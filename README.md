The ProximaX Sirius Chain Dart SDK works as a lightweight Dart library for interacting with the Sirius Blockchain. It provides a complete library set coverage, and supports synchronous and asynchronous requests.

**1. Depend on it**

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```dart
dependencies:
  xpx_chain_sdk: 0.0.6+6
```

**2. Install it**

You can install packages from the command line:

with pub:

```dart
$ pub get
```

with Flutter:

```dart
$ flutter packages get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support pub get or flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

**3. Import it**

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:xpx_chain_sdk/xpx_sdk.dart';
```
